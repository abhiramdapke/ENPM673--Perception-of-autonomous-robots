Scripts included:
 Implementation using inbuilt opencv  funtions:
	1. VO_inbuilt.py - Run this file

 Implementation using given pipeline:
	1. main.py - Run this file
	2. FindCorrespondence.py - Generates features between 2 frames using ORB. Matches the features using Brute Force Matcher. Finds the points of correspondence.

	4. RANSACForF.py - Implements RANSAC to reject outliers and get the best estimate of F
	5. EstimateEssentialMatrix.py - Estimates the Essential Matrix after the Fundamental Matrix is calculated
	6. EstimateCameraPose.py - Calcultes the 4 possible camera poses
	7. LinearTriangulation.py - Gets the 3d estimate for the 2d points by solving least squares using SVD
	8. Disambiguation.py - Narrows down the choice of (C, R) for the pose by checking for chirality condition

Dependencies:
1. OpenCV
2. Matplotlib
3. Tkinter
4. Numpy
5. mpl_toolkits 



Plotting:
Calculate the homogenous transfromation matrix from the rotation and translation obtained after disambiguation. New homogenous co-ordinates can be calculated and plotted.
